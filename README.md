**🍽️ Recipe Page Web Application**

📌**Project Overview**
The Recipe Page Web Application is a frontend project that displays recipe information by fetching data from an external API. This project was built to strengthen core frontend concepts, especially API integration and asynchronous JavaScript programming.
The application dynamically loads recipe data and presents it in a user-friendly layout, demonstrating how modern web applications handle real-time data efficiently.

🚀 **Features**
Fetches recipe data from an external API
Uses asynchronous functions (async/await) for smooth data handling
Displays recipes dynamically without page reload
Clean and responsive user interface
Error handling for failed API requests

🛠️ **Technologies Used**
HTML5 – Structure of the web page
CSS3 – Styling and layout
JavaScript (ES6+) – Application logic
Fetch API – To retrieve recipe data
Async / Await – For asynchronous operations

🔄**How It Works**
The user opens the recipe page.
JavaScript sends a request to the recipe API using the Fetch API.
The request is handled asynchronously using async/await.
The API response is processed and displayed dynamically on the webpage.
Errors (if any) are handled gracefully to improve user experience.

🎯****Learning Outcomes****
Understanding API-based data fetching
Practical use of asynchronous JavaScript
Working with real-time data
Improving frontend problem-solving skills

📌 **Future Enhancements**
Add search and filter functionality
Improve UI with animations
Add favorite recipes feature
Optimize performance and accessibility
